MooTools Core
=============

This branch is super experimental and likely doesn't work for you. If you need CommonJS with MooTools, contact me: http://cpojer.net

This repository is for MooTools developers; not users.
All users should download MooTools from [MooTools.net](http://mootools.net/download "Download MooTools")

[See the MooTools Wiki for more information](http://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/wikis)
